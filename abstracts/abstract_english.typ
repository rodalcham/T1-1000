This paper documents the development and implementation of output filtering enhancements for the TPM1 (Run Valuation) and TPM2 (Reverse Valuation) transactions within SAP Treasury and Risk Management. Prior to this enhancement, transaction output logs presented all messages without distinction, often containing several entries, which increased user workload, introduced risk of overlooking critical errors, and extended spool processing times.
The implemented solution enables selective message filtering, allowing users to display only errors, errors with warnings, or all messages. Following an eight-week development process, the centralized implementation leverages shared processing logic between both transactions, implementing filtering at a high abstraction level to minimize system modifications while maximizing reusability.

The enhancements are now operational in production and documented through SAP Notes for customer downport. The solution delivers measurable productivity gains through reduced log review time, improved error visibility, and decreased spool rendering overhead, while establishing a reusable foundation for similar improvements across other TRM transactions
